## Description

## Installation

3. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface.

## Usage

### Setting Default OpenGraph Data

1. After activating the plugin, go to your WordPress dashboard.

2. In the admin menu, you will find a new menu item called "OpenGraph Settings." Click on it.

3. On the "Default OpenGraph Settings" page, you can define default values for your OpenGraph tags, including the default title, description, and image URL.

4. Click the "Save Changes" button to save your default settings.

### Setting Custom OpenGraph Data for Posts and Pages

### Outputting OpenGraph Data

The plugin will automatically output the OpenGraph tags in the `<head>` section of your website when viewing a post or page. It uses the custom tags set for the post/page, or the default settings if no custom tags are set.
